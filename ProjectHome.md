This program, written in C# is meant to help keep track of finances. It uses SQLite.NET to wrap sqlite.dll for the database engine. I wanted to use an embedded portable db engine for lower overhead.

What this does:

Keep track of accounts, transactions, checks, credit cards.
Reconcile checking accounts
Chart spending habits

What this doesn't:
Stop you from spending frivolous amounts of money on things you, and by you I mean "we," don't need.
